# Go learn

## Resources

### Get going

Make a repo with the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/):

```sh
gh repo create golearn \
  --clone \
  --description "Resources from learning Go" \
  --disable-issues \
  --disable-wiki \
  --gitignore "Go" \
  --license "CC0-1.0" \
  --public
```

Go through these resources:

- [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1)
- [Learn Go with Tests](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests)

### Go deeper

- [Go docs](https://go.dev/doc/) (note that the Go docs don't have built-in search, despite the fact that Go comes from Google)
- [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) (I guess this is like the more comprehensive reference manual?)
- [Go Time podcast](https://changelog.com/gotime)
- [Domain-Driven Design with Go](https://www.packtpub.com/product/domain-driven-design-with-golang/9781804613450) (found via [Go Time 273](https://changelog.com/gotime/273))
